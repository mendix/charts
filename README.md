# Charts
Plot and compare your data across different charts.

### Available charts
* `Column Chart`
* `Line Chart`
* `Pie Chart`
* `Area Chart`
* `Bar Chart`

## Dependencies
* Mendix 7.8.0

## Demo projects
[https://charts102.mxapps.io](https://charts102.mxapps.io)

## Basic configuration

### Line chart
A line (scatter) chart should have one or more series, each displaying commonly grouped data points.
![LineChartProperties](/assets/LineChart_ChartProperties.png)

Data can be retrieved either from the database, or from a microflow.
Below are the properties for configuring series data:

* `name`[required] - Caption for series, shown on hover & on the legend.
* `Entity`[required] - Entity containing the series data points.
* `X-axis data attribute`[required] - The attribute that contains the data point X value.
* `Y-axis data attribute`[required] - The attribute that contains the data point Y value.
* `X-axis sort attribute` - The attribute to use for sorting the x-axis data.

NB: The line chart's x-axis provides support for dates and thus the line chart can be configured as a time series.

### Area chart
The area chart has data properties identical to those of the line chart.

### Column chart
The column chart has data properties identical to those of the line chart but for one distinction: no support for Date data type

### Bar chart
The bar chart configuration is identical to that of the column chart.

### Pie chart
Unlike the chart types above, the pie chart requires no series.
Below are the properties for configuring pie chart data:

* `Entity`[required] - The entity from which the data values will be retrieved.
* `Name attribute`[required] - The attribute that contains the data point captions.
* `Value attribute`[required] - The attribute that contains the data point values.
* `Color attribute`[required] - The attribute that contains the data point colors.
* `Sort attribute` - The attribute to use for sorting the x-axis data.

## Advanced configuration
The charts in this widget are based on the [https://github.com/mendixlabs/charts/issues](Plotly) library.
As such, the widget provides support for advanced users to extend or overwrite the basic settings by adding the chart properties as JSON.

To enable this feature, go to the "mode" option in the "Advanced" tab. 
For the line & column charts, each series has its own advanced tab for its own specialised configurations.

Below are the available advanced options and their usage:

### Layout options (all charts)
Layout options control the general appearance of the chart. Common options include; title, showlegend, xaxis, yaxis etc

    {
        "title": "My Chart"
        "showlegend": true
    }
    
### Data options (pie chart)
On the pie chart, the data options control the appearance of the pie circle beyond the general layout options. Options include hole, name, marker e.t.c

    {
        "name": "May Pie",
        "hole": 0.4,
        "hoverinfo": "label+percent+name",
        "textinfo": "none"
    }

### Series options (line & column charts)
The series options control the appearance of a specific series on the line or column chart. Options include line color, line shape e.t.c
